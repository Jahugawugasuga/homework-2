                        James and his family live in Bountiful, Utah. James and Alexia have been married four and a half years and had their first son Hugh in January of 2019. With previous education and experience in landscaping, James worked for a local company for 2.5 years before deciding to change directions into the tech industry. James grew up in Southern Alberta Canada with four sisters, three of whom have selected careers in the medical field. With his father currently serving as a provincial judge, there is certainly a great deal of pressure to find a suitable career and provide stability and success for his family.

                            Up to this point, the coding has been out of control. It's as if I was a wrecking ball operator, having just built my own home, and watching my own hands destroy my work, again and again. This activity has helped push me forward, though I do feel like there are still containers that affect other containers, some styles that affects other styles, hopefully I figure this part out soon.
